Purpose: The purpose of this program is to easily manage Augmented Intelligence server and memory data.
1. Setup and ensure the client and the server application are communicating.
2. Query that the MySQL backend is working and display database data members from specific tables and rows.
3. Long Term Vision Memory: Visual memory is created as individual frames or an image sequence. There is to be a function which renders the image sequence with FFMPEG and sends the rendered video to VLC for playback. **Ask if the sound should be played and rendered as well** | **Get a timeline of summarized events** | **This function needs to be replicated in the client**
    a. Get the time begin frame and display that frame from MySQL
    b. Get the time end frame and display that frame from MySQL
    c. Render the sequence with FFMPEG and play it
    b. Create a function to purge all of cached files
4. Long Term Visual Memory: Request individual frames from memory
5. Long Term Visual Memory: Save individual frames to a file location
6. Long Term Reading Memory: Open Reading memory given time constraints
7. Long Term Reading Memory: Open reading memory given categorization
    a. Make a list of categorized things read with OCR
    b. Comparison list of pre-uploaded books
8. Display inference and change in conceptual memory matrix
9. Short Term Memory: Create a copy of everything in short term memory
10. Client: Restore bits of short term memory at a given time
11. Create a way to organize memory into categories
    a. Update filepaths in MySQL
12. Object Location Memory: Find the last location of an object in memory and render a scrub of the frames
0. Generate log for all operations
